#Write a function for doing an in-place â†´ shuffle of a list.

#The shuffle must be "uniform," meaning each item in the original list must have the same probability 
# of ending up in each spot in the final list.

#Assume that you have a function get_random(floor, ceiling) for getting a random integer that is >= floor and <= ceiling.

    # Walk through from beginning to end
    for index_we_are_choosing_for in xrange(0, len(the_list) - 1):

        # Choose a random not-yet-placed item to place there
        # (could also be the item currently in that spot)
        # Must be an item AFTER the current item, because the stuff
        # before has all already been placed
